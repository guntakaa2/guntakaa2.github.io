## Overview

In this project, I created and deployed a professional personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages. The website includes resume information, professional background, contact info, skills, and a dedicated page introducing the WAPH course. I also implemented interactive features using JavaScript, jQuery, and public Web APIs such as JokeAPI and XKCD comic API.

Additionally, the website includes a digital and analog clock, a visit-tracking banner using cookies, and a flag counter. This assignment helped me reinforce both front-end development and web security practices.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to integrate HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and external APIs into a cohesive professional portfolio. I also practiced using cookies for client-side storage and GitHub Pages for hosting. The hands-on nature of this assignment helped me better understand DOM manipulation, asynchronous requests, and responsive design.
